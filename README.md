This is an Android music player application
I developed in order to improve the music listening experience for users. A key proponent for user disatisfaction are service-commercials and having to browse multiple minutes through their bracket for the song they want to listen to next. Cero's Music Player aims to fix that by gathering all device songs into a single place for easy access. Songs are placed into a list you can scroll up and down or filter by name with a search bar.


Tools used: Android Studio, Android SDK, Java, XML

Features:

- List of Songs
- Responsive search functionality
- Multiple aesthetic song displays w/ buttons
- Shuffle & Repeat Functionality
- Media Style Notifications w/ Control Buttons
- Works with Bluetooth Device Buttons
- AudioFocus

Future:
- User-Defined Playlists
- Accessibility
- Choice of Theme (Background Color)

# Application Flow
You must be using an android device for this application to work.

1) Open the "Cero's Music Player" application on your android device.
2) You should be prompted to grant the app basic media permissions. Click "allow". The
app should perform a media search query on the device for audio files with extensions, such as .mp3, or .wav.
When the query is finished, all device songs should appear on screen in a list.

Song files have information detailing:
- Song name
- Song artist
- Song duration

3) Scroll down to the song you want to play, or alternatively, use the search bar. Tap on the song you want to play.
This will prompt the song to play and open another activity page with song info, a scroll bar, and buttons (skip previous,
pause/play, skip next, shuffle, repeat). A notification bar will also popup allowing you to control music from outside of the app.

4) That's it. Enjoy!
